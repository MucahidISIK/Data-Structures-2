In the beginning of the program user has to write the number of the baskets it wants. After creating the right amount of baskets user can use the menu. Menu has 7 different options  :
 - Add Balls : This option creates balls in the baskets which is in heap.
 - Delete Balls : This option deletes the balls.
 - Switch Baskets : This option asks for the baskets you want to switch then switches their places.
 - Switch Balls : Same as the 3rd option.
